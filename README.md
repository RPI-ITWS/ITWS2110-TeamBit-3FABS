What is 3FABS?
    3FABS is a brand new photography social media site
    Similar to sites like Instagram or Pinterest. 
    It is a platform that takes any image and crushes it down to 1 bit (Boolean black or white) and 300x300 pixels 
    Even though it may look like greyscale, the images on the right are only 2 colors! This is how 2 color shading works
    Once you have that image, you can share it with fellow photographers around the world!
    You’ll be able to leave likes, comments, and share posts via links as well on posts you can find via the main “browse feed”
    Finding fellow photographers will never be easier!
    You will also have an account, which will show all of your photos! Gain followers and share your account with friends!
